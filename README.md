# Homebridge ADB

Not so simple homebridge plugin to control remote ADB enabled Android device. The idea is to make random Android based TV box can be controlled with Home App. It make any Android device appear as TV accesory. Where you can control on/off status, volume and dpad control via Control Center remote, and launch certain predefined app defined in the configuration.

This plugins register it self as external accesorries. Make sure after adding Homebridge bridge in Home App, manually "add accesories" to add the android device in the Home App.

## Prerequisite

1. Install Homebridge, Homebridge Config UI X (this plugin support web configuration over there), and this plugins
	```
	sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge homebridge-adb
	```

2. Install ADB tools inside Homebridge server. Open Homebridge Config UI X in your browser then navigate to terminal or ssh to your homebridge server, and then run this command:
	* If the homebridge server run inside Ubuntu, use this command:
		```
		sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
		```
	*  Or, if the homebridge run inside Docker container like the one from oznu/docker-homebridge, please refer to **Docker container** section
	*  Or, if you're using other OS, please refer this link to download the ADB tools: [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
	*  Check if the ADB installed properly by running this command:
		```
		adb --version
		```
		This will output something like `Android Debug Bridge version x.x.x`

3. Enable Developer mode in your Android device, visit this documentation for more information [https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)

4. **IMPORTANT**: Some Android device doesn't support "Remote ADB" by default. If your device is one of them, connect your device with USB cable to any computer with ADB installed. Open terminal and run this command:
	```
	adb tcpip 5555
	```
	if no error produced, disconnect unplug the USB cable from the computer.

5. _OPTIONAL_ Run this command to make sure you can connect to device:
	```
	adb connect your-device-ip
	```
	If all goes well, there will be a popup window in your android device asking for debug permission. After you accept the request, you might want to do kill the adb server to make a fresh connection
	```
	adb kill-server
	```
	After that reconnect your device again with previous adb connect. Test your adb connection by running this command:
	```
	adb -s your-device-ip shell "getprop ro.product.model"
	```
	This command will output your device model.

### Docker container based on [oznu/docker-homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge)

*  **MANDATORY** If you're using a container based on Alpine Linux (like `oznu/docker-homebridge:latest`), run this command in terminal to install adb
	```shell
	# Install adb, required by the homebridge-adb plugin
	apk --update-cache --repository http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.14/community/ add android-tools
	```
	You can use other version of repo, but I only tested the v3.14 repo, and it seems it's the only adb tools that work with oznu/docker-homebridge .

* **MANDATORY** If you're using a container based on Debian (like the `oznu/docker-homebridge:ubuntu` & `oznu/docker-homebridge:debian` docker image), run this command in terminal to install adb
	```shell
	# Update apt package index
	apt-get update

	# Install adb, required by the homebridge-adb plugin
	apt-get install -y android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
	```

*  _OPTIONAL_ Append the followings line to your `config/startup.sh` to install this plugin on every container restart:
	```shell
	# Install the homebridge-adb plugin
	npm install homebridge-adb
	```
	
* _OPTIONAL_ If you run into issues when connecting your android device (sometimes adb can't create the `$HOME/.android/adbkey`), add this line to your `config/startup.sh`:
	```shell
	# Fix connection issues for the homebridge-adb plugin
	adb connect $YOUR_ANDROID_DEVICE_IP
	```



## Configuration

Here an example of configuration that you can use. If you're using Homebridge Config UI X, you can configure your device there, but there's a small hiccup with Inputs. It only display one input, but if you press add, it will display the rest of the inputs.

* **platform** (mandatory): the name of this plugin.
* **name** (mandatory): the name of the accessory.
* **ip** (mandatory): the IP address of the accessory.
* *mac* (optional): the MAC address of the accessory. When provided and your accessory support Wake On LAN, this plugin will try to use Wake On LAN to Turn On your accessory. Useful if your accessory disconnect ADB connection after it turned off.

To know your app id, please see your Homebridge log. When you leave this blank, and set *hidehhome* and *hideother* to true, the plugins will hide inputs in Home App.
	* *name* (mandatory): the name of the input.
	* *id* (mandatory): the application id. The id will be use for input switcher in Home app. If you put random id, the input will move to "other".
	* *adb* (optional): you can run your own ADB shell command here, such as: `monkey -p com.app.id 1`. This is an ADB shell command, so you doesn't need to type "adb -s ipaddress shell ...".

See [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent) for the keycode list. You can also put a shell script instead of keycode to run your own command. Put `shell` identifier to let the plugins know it's a shell script, eg: `volumeup: "shell sh ./myscript.sh"`
* *hidenumber* (optional): if set to *true*, plugin will hide number inputs in Home App.
* *hidehome* (optional): if set to *true*, plugin will hide "Home" input in Home App.
